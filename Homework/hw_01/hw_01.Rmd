## Introduction

I am **Suliat Alli**, a fourth year PhD. candidate at the Department of Chemistry, LSU. My research is focused on evaluating and improving small molecules that can serve as antibiotics against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a gram-negative bacteria. I use various techniques such as spectroscopy and computational tools to study the interaction between these probable drug molecules and their target in the bacteria.
